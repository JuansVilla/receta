    <h2>Step by Step</h2>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by whisking together 850 grams of bread flour and 12 grams of
            instant yeast in a mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Once the dry ingredients are evenly dispersed, add 550 grams of
            water to the bowl and combine. Next, add 17 grams of kosher salt
            before kneading the dough using your method of choice.</li>
        <li>Place the dough into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. For
            what is known as primary bulk fermentation, let the dough rest at
            room temperature for 2 hours. Or, for what is known as a cold
            ferment, let the dough rest inside of the refrigerator for 3-5 days.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces by weight to ensure accuracy.
            Shape each piece into balls by rolling the dough between your hands
            and pinching the edges down underneath the dough itself until each
            piece is as round and taut as possible.</li>
        <li>Place the balls of dough on a lightly floured rimmed baking sheet or
            inside of a proofing container. </li>
        <li>Cover and proof for 1 hour if you made the dough the same day or 1 ½
            - 2 hours if the dough is refrigerator cold. The dough should spread
            out, but not quite double in size.</li>
        <li>Flour both your work surface and the dough itself and pat the dough
            out as wide as possible with your fingers. Leave a very small rim
            around the outside that will eventually become the crust.</li>
        <li>Begin gently and slowly stretching the dough by passing it knuckle
            over knuckle until it is as thin as you can get it, which in this
            case, is about 12 inches wide. Place the stretched out dough on a
            generously floured pizza peel.</li>
        <li>Roughly purée 1 can of whole San Marzano tomatoes and add a generous
            pinch of kosher salt. Separately shred or tear pieces of fresh
            mozzarella. </li>
        <li>Apply the pureed tomatoes and mozzarella cheese very sparingly on
            top of the pizza dough.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the oven at 932°F for only about one minute. Once
            it emerges from the oven, top it off with some fresh basil. Slice
            and serve as desired. </li>
    </ol>
